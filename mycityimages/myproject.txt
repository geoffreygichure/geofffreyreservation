class of travel which the input will on a drop down 



/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
the second thing is how many pages will this thing have  to know that i must have the process of how the applicant will have to interact with the system 
1first the system will allow the user to enter into the system and see the servicese that we are offring 
2. if user want to travell he / she will be requested to create an account
3 after creating an account the use will fill in the data like destination and subit the user will be requested to pay
ether withe any paying method 
4 after paying the user will recieve a message from their email to confirm that the user has successfuly  plied and the in formariion such as card will be sent to the email

??//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

creating the front end/////
this will have  the main page having the information about the airline 
it will have a menu to help user navigate the application properly
the navigation data will be 
home 
about
contact

///
in the home the will be images of travellers revealling the beauty of our travel may be like 3 main piccture 
the application will be a simple to anable people to navigate 
inside country . there will be a main navigation place with links represented by images this images will represnt the main cities in the country
 the affter clicking the the city links this will anable the user to select any route of travelling from that city

/////
in about infomain  i will provide information about ourservices history and our ambitions and objectives


i will write code usin html, javascript and css and nodejs

////////////
the main part is using javascript to connect the system like calculating the the cash money as a resalt of user prefence of travel either middle class  of high class 
also the functionality of returning the money if the use cancell the travel

unctionality, and code examples.

1. Database Structure (Tables)

Users Table:
user_id (INT, Primary Key, Auto-increment)
firstname (VARCHAR)
lastname (VARCHAR)
email (VARCHAR, Unique)
gender (VARCHAR)
date_of_birth (DATE)
password (VARCHAR, Hashed)
Travels Table:
travel_id (INT, Primary Key, Auto-increment)
user_id (INT, Foreign Key referencing Users.user_id)
place_of_travel (VARCHAR)
destination (VARCHAR)
time_of_application (TIME)
date_of_application (DATE)
Payments Table:
payment_id (INT, Primary Key, Auto-increment)
travel_id (INT, Foreign Key referencing Travels.travel_id)
passport_number (VARCHAR)
amount (DECIMAL)
class_of_travel (VARCHAR)
2. Application Flow (Pages)

Home Page:
Displays airline information, images, and city links.
Navigation menu (Home, About, Contact).
City/Route Selection:
Displays routes available from the selected city.
Login/Signup Page:
Login form (email, password).
Signup form (firstname, lastname, email, password, gender, date of birth).
Travel Details Page:
Form for travel details (destination, time, class).
Payment Page:
Displays travel cost.
Payment options.
Passport number input.
Confirmation Page/Email:
Displays travel confirmation.
Email is sent with confirmation and travel details.
Cancellation Page:
Allows user to cancel travel.
Displays refund amount and timeframe.
3. Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

HTML:
Structure the pages with divs, forms, and input elements.
Use semantic HTML5 tags (header, nav, main, footer).
CSS:
Style the pages for a clean and user-friendly interface.
Use CSS frameworks (Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS) for faster development.
JavaScript:
Handle form submissions, validation, and dynamic content updates.
Use AJAX (fetch or XMLHttpRequest) to communicate with the Node.js backend.
Calculate the refunds.
4. Backend (Node.js)

Express.js:
Create a web server and handle API requests.
Database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB):
Store and retrieve data.
Use an ORM/ODM (Sequelize, Mongoose) for easier database interaction.
Authentication:
Implement user authentication (JWT).
Hash passwords (bcrypt).
Payment Processing:
Integrate with a payment gateway (Stripe, PayPal).
Email Service:
Use Nodemailer to send confirmation emails.
Refund Logic:
Create a function that calculates the refund amount based on the cancellation time and transaction fees.
Code Snippets (Illustrative)

HTML (Signup Form):
HTML

<form id="signupForm">
  <input type="text" name="firstname" placeholder="First Name">
  <input type="text" name="lastname" placeholder="Last Name">
  <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Email">
  <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password">
  <select name="gender">
    <option value="male">Male</option>
    <option value="female">Female</option>
    <option value="other">Other</option>
  </select>
  <input type="date" name="date_of_birth">
  <button type="submit">Signup</button>
</form>
JavaScript (Frontend - Signup):
JavaScript

document.getElementById('signupForm').addEventListener('submit', async (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  const formData = new FormData(event.target);
  const response = await fetch('/api/signup', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: formData,
  });
  const data = await response.json();
  if (response.ok) {
    alert('Signup successful!');
    // Redirect to login page
  } else {
    alert(data.message);
  }
});
Node.js (Backend - Signup):
JavaScript

const express = require('express');
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const db = require('./db'); // Database connection

const app = express();
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
app.use(express.json());

app.post('/api/signup', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(req.body.password, 10);
    await db.query('INSERT INTO users (firstname, lastname, email, password, gender, date_of_birth) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)', [
      req.body.firstname,
      req.body.lastname,
      req.body.email,
      hashedPassword,
      req.body.gender,
      req.body.date_of_birth
    ]);
    res.json({ message: 'Signup successful' });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    res.status(500).json({ message: 'Signup failed' });
  }
});

// Example of refund calculation.
function calculateRefund(totalAmount, cancellationTime) {
    //Logic to calculate refund based on time of cancellation.
    let refundAmount = 0;
    if (cancellationTime > someTimeLimit){
        refundAmount = totalAmount - (totalAmount * 0.1) // 10% fees
    } else {
        refundAmount = totalAmount - (totalAmount * 0.25) // 25% fees
    }
    return refundAmount;
}

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running'));
Key Considerations

Security: Hash passwords, sanitize user inputs, and use HTTPS.
Payment Gateway Integration: Research and choose a suitable payment gateway.
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling on both the frontend and backend.
User Experience (UX): Design a user-friendly interface and provide clear instructions.
Database Security: secure your database from sql injection and other attacks.
Scalability: Design the system to handle a growing number of users.
Testing: Write unit and integration tests.
This comprehensive guide should give you a strong foundation for building your travel application. Remember to break down the project into smaller, manageable tasks and iterate on your design and implementation.
